RetKit is a library for interacting with Restful web services in Objective C. It provides a set of primitives for interacting with web services wrapping GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP verbs behind a clean, simple interface. RestKit also provides a system for modeling remote resources by mapping them from XML/JSON payloads back into domain objects. Model mapping functions with normal NSObject derived classes with properties. There is also a model mapping implementation included that provides a Core Data backed store for persisting objects loaded from the web.

# Dependencies

RestKit currently utilizes ElementParser for parsing XML payloads and JSON framework for parsing JSON payloads.

Additional parsing backend support is expected in future versions.

# Installation

To add RestKit to your project (you're using git, right?):
git submodule add git://github.com/twotoasters/ElementParser.git ElementParser
git submodule add git://github.com/twotoasters/RestKit.git RestKit
git submodule add git://github.com/stig/json-framework.git json-framework

Open RestKit.xcodeproj and drag the RestKit project file into your XCode project.

Next add RestKit as a direct dependency to your target.

Add 'RestKit' and 'ElementParser/Classes' to your target's header search paths.

Add libRestKit.a to your target (checkbox)

Be sure to enable the -ObjC in your Target settings under "Build" > "Other Linker Flags"
