OTRestFramework is a library for interacting with Restfull web services in Objective C. It uses ElementParser to return xml documents that can be easily worked with. It is under active development and is not complete.

To add OTRestFramework to your project (you're using git, right?):
git submodule add git://github.com/Objective3/ElementParser.git ElementParser
git submodule add git://github.com/Objective3/OTRestFramework.git OTRestFramework

Open OTRestFramework.xcodeproj and drag the OTRestFramework project file into your xcode project.

Next add OTRestFramework as a direct dependency to your target.

Add 'OTRestFramework' and 'ElementParser/Classes' to your target's header search paths.

Add libOTRestFramework.a to your target (checkbox)
